# ðŸ§¶ BTRFS automatic snapshot

### â›” This repository has been archived and is no longer actively maintained. â›”
### â›” I recommend [Snapper](https://github.com/openSUSE/snapper) for taking snapshots of your system. â›”

Create snapshots automatically with a configuration file !

## ðŸš€ Installation
To install this script, first clone this repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kaniville/btrfs-autosnap
$ cd btrfs-autosnap
```

You can now copy the different files to their respective locations:
```
# mv snapshot.py /usr/local/bin/snapshot
```

```
# mkdir /etc/pacman.d/hooks
# mv snapshot.hook /etc/pacman.d/hooks/snapshot.hook
```

And finally, generate the default configuration file:
```
# snapshot --generate
```

## ðŸ’Ž Usage
You can display the help by entering the command `snapshot --help`.

Snapshots are created automatically before each Archlinux update.

You can configure some options and choose which subvolumes will be snapshot by editing `/etc/snapshot/snapshot.conf`:
```conf
[subvolumes] # You can add subvolumes here
root = /

[main] # Constants
snapshot_dir = /.snapshots
keep_snapshots = 5
```
